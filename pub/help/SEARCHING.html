<H1>How can I search the Web?</H1>

<p>SatelLife provides an e-mail gateway for selected WWW search
engines.  These search engines allow you to search the World Wide Web
through e-mail.  Currently supported are the Infoseek, Yahoo, and
AltaVista search engines.

<p><A HREF="PROMED.html">Help on using the ProMED search engine is also
available.</A>

<hr>

<p>The <A HREF=http://www.yahoo.com>Yahoo</A> search engine allows you to
search through a carefully indexed list of World-Wide Web sites.  It
will produce a small list of well-organized sites which may have the
information you are searching for.

<p>We also provide a gateway into the <A
HREF="http://www.infoseek.com/">Infoseek</A> and <A
HREF="http://altavista.digital.com/">AltaVista</A> search engines.  These
search engines allow you to search through the entire World Wide Web,
producing a larger set of possible sites, but the probability of any
given site having the information you're looking for may be lower than
with Yahoo.  Infoseek also allows you to search through Usenet
archives.

<hr>

<p>To access one of these search engines, send a message to
getweb@usa.healthnet.org with the following line:

<p>SEARCH &lt;engine&gt; &lt;keywords...&gt;

<p>with "engine" replaced by either YAHOO, ALTAVISTA, or INFOSEEK
depending on which search engine you want to use.

<hr>

<p>For example, to search for Yahoo categories relating to the Ebola
virus outbreak in Zaire, you might send this message to
getweb@usa.healthnet.org:

<p><code>SEARCH YAHOO ebola zaire</code>

<p>You would receive a message containing these lines:

<pre>Found 3 matches containing ebola zaire.  Displaying matches 1-3.

...

* Ebola Epidemic in Zaire[9]
* Ebola Outbreak in Zaire - Updates[10]
* Primary Sources: The Ebola in Zaire[11] - from the Nando Times.

...

[9] http://www.uct.ac.za/microbiology/ebopage.html
[10] http://www.bocklabs.wisc.edu/outbreak.html
[11] http://www.nando.net/newsroom/zairesources.html</pre>
<hr>

<p>To gain more information about entry number 10, labelled 'Ebola
Outbreak in Zaire', you could then send a message to
getweb@usa.healthnet.org with the message body:

<p><code>SEND http://www.bocklabs.wisc.edu/outbreak.html</code>

<hr>

<p>We also provide a gateway to the powerful AltaVista search engine.
To search the entire World-Wide Web for information about tobacco and
lung cancer, send this message to getweb@usa.healthnet.org:

<p><code>SEARCH ALTAVISTA tobacco "lung cancer"</code>

<p>To search through healthnet.org home pages for information on
the Ebola virus, send this message:

<p><code>SEARCH ALTAVISTA host:healthnet.org ebola</code>

<p>The <A
HREF="http://altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=h&what=web">AltaVista
Help page</A> contains additional information on query syntax.

<hr>

<p>Finally, we also provide a gateway to the popular InfoSeek search
engine.  To search the entire World-Wide Web for information about
exercise and rats, type:

<p><code>SEARCH INFOSEEK exercise rats</code>

<o>This can lead to possibly useful information (like a Mouse and Rat
Research Home Page), as well as to useless information (like the home
page of someone who refers to himself as "Rat".)

<p>By default, Infoseek will search the World-Wide Web.  However,
Infoseek recognizes the following keywords:  

<ul>
<li>NN searches Usenet newsgroups.</li>
<li>CT searches the Infoseek Company Directory.</li>
<li>EM searches a database of known e-mail addresses.</li>
<li>NW searches through the past month of news.</li>
<li>FQ searches through a collection of FAQ documents.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, to search for recent news on the 15-year-old search for a cure
for AIDS, submit this query:

<p><code>SEARCH INFOSEEK NW cure aids</code>

<p>The <A
HREF="http://guide.infoseek.com/Help?pg=SearchHlp.html&sv=IS&lk=lcd">Infoseek
Search Tips</A> page explains how to create more complex queries, like
a query which finds only pages which contain the phrase "San
Francisco":

<p><code>SEARCH INFOSEEK city guide +San Francisco</code>

<hr>

Please note that SatelLife is in no way affiliated with Infoseek,
AltaVista, or Yahoo, and cannot be responsible for the accuracy of
these search engines or for the content of retreived WWW documents.
