<H1>How can I request raw HTML source rather than formatted text?</H1>

<p>The SOURCE modifier specifies that HTML documents should be
sent as HTML source rather than as modified plain-text.

<p>To receive the healthnet home-page as source, send this command:

<p><code>GET SOURCE http://www.healthnet.org</code>

<p><A HREF=HELP.html>Back to the main help page</A>
