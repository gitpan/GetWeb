<H1>About SatelLife</H1>

<p>SatelLife is an international not-for-profit organization employing
satellite, telephone and radio networking technology to serve the
health communication and information needs of countries in the
developing world.

<p>More information is available at the SatelLife home page:

<p>http://www.healthnet.org

<p>If you do not have Web access, you can still access the home page
by sending a message to getweb@usa.healthnet.org with the body:

<p>GET http://www.healthnet.org

<H1>How to use the GetWeb MailBot server</H1>

<p>This software is currently in beta testing.  Please report any
problems to getweb-admin@usa.healthnet.org.

<p>Please note all requests are logged; we cannot guarantee that your
requests will remain private.

<p>To request a document from the World Wide Web, send a message to
getweb@usa.healthnet.org with the body containing one or more requests
like:

<p>GET url

<p>Where url is the URL of the document you request.  If the message
contains more than one request, separate each request with a blank
line.

<p>Here is a message which would fetch the HealthNet home page:

<p><code>GET http://www.healthnet.org</code>

<p>After recieving the above message, the GetWeb server would
format the HealthNet home page as human-readable plain-text and
send it to you.

<p>You can enclose your commands in a begin/end block, or comment out
lines with '#':

<PRE>
This preamble will not be processed by the MailBot...
begin
GET http://www.healthnet.org
# ...neither will this comment
end
...and neither will this signature.
</PRE>

<p>A <A HREF="HOTLIST.html">hotlist</A> of URLs which we consider
especially interesting is available.

<p>Each hypertext link is represented by a number in brackets.
Suppose you get a message like this from a GetWeb server:

<hr>
<PRE>Some important conferences carried by SatelLife include:

     * ProMED: Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases[1]
     * ProCAARE: Program for Collaboration Against AIDS[2]
     * E-Drug: Essential Drugs[3]

** References from this document **

[2] http://www.healthnet.org/programs/procaare.html
[3] http://www.healthnet.org/programs/edrug.html</PRE>
<hr>

To get more information about ProCAARE, you would look up link 2 at
the bottom of the message to find out the URL is
http://www.healthnet.org/programs/procaare.html.  You would then send
a message to the GetWeb server:

<p><code>GET http://www.healthnet.org/programs/procaare.html</code>
