<H1>How can I follow chains of linked documents with a single command?</H1>

<p>If you know what link you're going to follow from an intermediate
document, you do not need to download the intermediate document.  You
can instead save time and bandwidth by using the FOLLOW command.

<p>Suppose http://www.healthnet.org/programs/ looks like this:

<PRE>Some important conferences carried by SatelLife include:

     * ProMED: Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases[1]
     * ProCAARE: Program for Collaboration Against AIDS[2]
     * E-Drug: Essential Drugs[3]

<p>If you send a message to the GetWeb server with the text:

<p><code>GET http://www.healthnet.org/programs/ FOLLOW 2</code>

<p>The server will send you the description of ProCAARE.

<p>You can chain together multiple FOLLOW directives.  If you already
know you're going to want the fifth document linked to the ProCAARE
page, send a message like this:

<p><code>GET http://www.healthnet.org/programs/ FOLLOW 2 FOLLOW 5</code>

<p>This would reduce the total turnaround time, since you would get
the desired final document in one e-mail round trip rather than in
three.
