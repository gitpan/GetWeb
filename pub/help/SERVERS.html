<H1>What other GetWeb-type servers are available?</H1>

<p>Agora (w3mail) servers also provide Web access to e-mail, similar
to GetWeb.  Send a document with the body 'HELP' to any of the
following addresses:

<ul>
<li>agora@dna.affrc.go.jp
<li>agora@kamakura.mss.co.jp
<li>agora@info.lanic.utexas.edu
</ul>

<p>The GetWeb server software is freeware; if your organization or an
organization you work with has Web access, why not ask them to run a
GetWeb server themselves?  Contact getweb-admin@usa.healthnet.org for
more info.

<p>For a more up-to-date list of servers, send a message to
mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the body:

<p>send usenet/news.answers/internet-services/access-via-email
