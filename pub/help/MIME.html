<H1>How can I decode binary files?</H1>

<p>Binary messages are sent as Base64 MIME file-attaches.  Like
UUEncode, MIME is a method of encoding binary files into a mailable
text format.

<p>The current versions of Eudora Lite and (UUCP) Pegasus both support
MIME.

<p>If you can't change your mailer, you can always use a very basic
standalone MIME-reading program like <A
HREF=ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/mpack/>mpack</A>.

<p>As an alternative, the NOMIME modifier allows you to retrive binary
files uuencoded rather than in MIME format.  So, to get the zipped
copy of the mpack mailer in uuencode format:

<p><code>SEND NOMIME ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/mpack/mpack15d.zip</code>

<p>More detailed information about MIME and about various decoders and
mailers is available in the <A
HREF="/pub/usenet-by-group/news.answers/mail/mime-faq">MIME FAQ.</A>

<p>GetWeb does not send out files longer than 100k.
