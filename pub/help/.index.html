<H1>How to access GetWeb</H1>

<p>Please note access to this server is logged; we cannot guarantee
that your requests will remain private.

<p>To request a document from the World Wide Web, send a message to
getweb@usa.healthnet.org with the body containing one or more requests
like:

<p>GET url

<p>Where url is the URL of the document you request.  If the message
contains more than one request, separate each request with a blank
line.

<p>Here is a message which would fetch the HealthNet home page:

<p><code>GET http://www.healthnet.org</code>

<p>After receiving the above message, the GetWeb server would
format the HealthNet home page as human-readable plain-text and
send it to you.

<p>A <A HREF="HOTLIST.html">hotlist</A> of URLs which we consider
especially interesting is available.

<p>Each hypertext link is represented by a number in brackets.
Suppose you get a message like this from a GetWeb server:

<hr>
<PRE>Some important conferences carried by SatelLife include:

     * ProMED: Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases[1]
     * ProCAARE: Program for Collaboration Against AIDS[2]
     * E-Drug: Essential Drugs[3]

** References from this document **
[1] http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html
[2] http://www.healthnet.org/programs/procaare.html
[3] http://www.healthnet.org/programs/edrug.html</PRE>
<hr>

To get more information about ProCAARE, you would look up link 2 at
the bottom of the message to find out the URL is
http://www.healthnet.org/programs/procaare.html.  You would then send
a message to the GetWeb server:

<p><code>GET http://www.healthnet.org/programs/procaare.html</code>

<p>If your mailer program insists puts extra, unwanted text at the
beginning or end of your message, then you can enclose your commands
in a begin/end block.  You can also comment out lines with '#', so
that in the following message only the 'GET http://www.healthnet.org'
line will be processed:

<PRE>
Hello getweb@usa.healthnet.org!
This preamble will not be processed by the MailBot...

begin

GET http://www.healthnet.org

# ...neither will this comment

end
...and neither will this signature:
