<H1>How can I control how my documents are delivered?</H1>

<p>The TO user@host modifier specifies that documents
should be sent to user@host rather than to the original
send address.

<p>To send the healthnet home-page as source to me@myotheraddress.com,
send this command:

<p><code>GET TO my@myotheraddress.com http://www.healthnet.org</code>

<p>Messages are split into chunks of about 20k by default.  To raise
or lower this value, use the SPLIT command.  The following command
splits the file into 40k chunks instead:

<p>SPLIT 40000 http://www.big.com/mybigfile.html
