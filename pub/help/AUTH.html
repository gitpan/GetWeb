<H1>How can I pass in my username and password?</H1>

<p>The USER and PASSWORD modifiers are used together, like this:

<p>GET USER myname PASSWORD mypass &lt;rest of command&gt;

<p>For example:

<p>GET USER terry PASSWORD foo http://www.wherever.com

<p>Passwords, like everything else in GetWeb, are not necessarily
private, because:

<ul>
<li>GetWeb logs all transactions locally
<li>GetWeb's HTTP transactions with the server are unencrypted and may be intercepted by people on the internet
</ul>

<p>Plus, if your email goes through the internet backbone, your email
may be read by anyone at intermediate internet hosts as it hops from
host to host on the way to the internet. (Look at the 'Received'
headers and see all the machines email travels through.) So, don't
send any sensitive information over this insecure channel.
