<H1>How quotas limit server load</H1>

<p>Casual users on this server are limited to a certain maximum number
of bytes, and a certain maximum number of messages.  Syntax errors and
access to pages on this server are generally not counted towards this
total.

<p>Quotas are currently about 70 document requests or 7000 outgoing
kilobytes for most users during the course of a week.

<p>Quotas are regenerated after seven full days; for example, if you
run out of quota on a Wedensday, you will be able to use the system
again the next Wedensday.  If you run out on a Friday, you will have
to wait until the following Friday.
