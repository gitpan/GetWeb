<H1>How can I fill out HTML forms?</H1>

<p>Pages containing HTML forms have &lt;GETWEB: FORM A&gt; at the
beginning of each form.  To fill out the form, forward the message
containing the form back to the server, filling out any inputs
surrounded by braces: []

For example, if you send a command to get <A
HREF="http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html"> the ProMED page</A>,
part of the document will look like this:

<hr><PRE>
&lt;GETWEB: FORM A&gt;

Search the entire archive: ProMED-mail

String to search for: [______________________________]
[ ] Submit: check preceding box and forward to GetWeb
[ ]Case sensitive     [ ]Partial match

Return only files modified within the last [_____] days.
Maximum number of files returned:

      [ ] 10
   OR [X] 50
   OR [ ] 100
   OR [ ] 1000
</PRE><hr>

<p>To search for 'ebola' and 'zaire' within the last 200 days,
returning the top 10 matching files, you would fill out the form as
follows:

<hr><PRE>
&lt;GETWEB: FORM A&gt;

Search the entire archive: ProMED-mail

String to search for: [__________ebola zaire____________________]
[X ] Submit: check preceding box and forward to GetWeb
[ ]Case sensitive     [X ]Partial match

Return only files modified within the last [_\200____] days.
Maximum number of files returned:

      [X ] 10
   OR [] 50
   OR [ ] 100
   OR [ ] 1000
</PRE><hr>

Note the '\' before the 200.  When filling out a form input, you must
'escape' the following characters by preceding them with a backslash
(\):

<ul>
<li> Number: write 3 as \3, you can write 50 as \50 or \5\0
<li> Braces: write [ as \[, and ] as \]
<li> Underscores: write _ as \_
<li> Backslashes themselves: write a literal \ as \\
</ul>

<p>Remember to 'X' the box where it says to 'check preceding box', or the
form will not be processed.

<p>Finally, make sure to fill out at most one box in each radio button
group or menu.  Radio buttons look like this:

<pre>
Choose ([X]) Blue or ([ ]) Green, but not both!
</pre>

Menus look like this:

<pre>
Choose:

     [X] Red
  OR [ ] Black

but not both!
</pre>
