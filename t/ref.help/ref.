 How to access GetWeb
=====================

Please note access to this server is logged; we cannot guarantee that
your requests will remain private.

To request a document from the World Wide Web, send a message to
getweb@usa.healthnet.org with the body containing one or more
requests like:

GET url

Where url is the URL of the document you request. If the message
contains more than one request, separate each request with a blank
line.

Here is a message which would fetch the HealthNet home page:

GET http://www.healthnet.org

After receiving the above message, the GetWeb server would format the
HealthNet home page as human-readable plain-text and send it to you.

A hotlist[1] of URLs which we consider especially interesting is
available.

Each hypertext link is represented by a number in brackets. Suppose
you get a message like this from a GetWeb server:

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Some important conferences carried by SatelLife include:

     * ProMED: Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases[1]
     * ProCAARE: Program for Collaboration Against AIDS[2]
     * E-Drug: Essential Drugs[3]

[2] http://www.healthnet.org/programs/procaare.html
[3] http://www.healthnet.org/programs/edrug.html

--------------------------------------------------------------------

To get more information about ProCAARE, you would look up link 2 at
the bottom of the message to find out the URL is
http://www.healthnet.org/programs/procaare.html. You would then send
a message to the GetWeb server:

GET http://www.healthnet.org/programs/procaare.html

If your mailer program insists puts extra, unwanted text at the
beginning or end of your message, then you can enclose your commands
in a begin/end block. You can also comment out lines with '#', so
that in the following message only the 'GET http://www.healthnet.org'
line will be processed:


Hello getweb@usa.healthnet.org!
This preamble will not be processed by the MailBot...

begin

GET http://www.healthnet.org

# ...neither will this comment

end
...and neither will this signature:

 About the GetWeb MailBot server software
=========================================

GetWeb was developed by SatelLife.[1] SatelLife is an international
not-for-profit organization employing satellite, telephone and radio
networking technology to serve the health communication and
information needs of countries in the developing world.

Please address any suggestions to the author, Rolf Nelson.[2]

Funding was provided by the American Physiological Society[3],
Management Sciences for Health[4], NEC[5], and the National Science
Foundation[6].

SatelLife wishes to thank CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle
Physics[7], for its role in the development of methods of offline Web
access, especially for developing the Agora (W3mail) Server software.

Special thanks also to the author of Agora, Arthur Secret[8]; and to
Hugh Sasse[9] and Guido Hansen[10], who have used their prior
experience running w3mail servers to provide invaluable input to the
development process.
