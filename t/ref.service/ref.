 About SatelLife
================

SatelLife is an international not-for-profit organization employing
satellite, telephone and radio networking technology to serve the
health communication and information needs of countries in the
developing world.

More information is available at the SatelLife home page:

http://www.healthnet.org

If you do not have Web access, you can still access the home page by
sending a message to getweb@usa.healthnet.org with the body:

GET http://www.healthnet.org



How to use the GetWeb MailBot server
====================================

This software is currently in beta testing. Please report any
problems to getweb-admin@usa.healthnet.org.

Please note all requests are logged; we cannot guarantee that your
requests will remain private.

To request a document from the World Wide Web, send a message to
getweb@usa.healthnet.org with the body containing one or more
requests like:

GET url

Where url is the URL of the document you request. If the message
contains more than one request, separate each request with a blank
line.

Here is a message which would fetch the HealthNet home page:

GET http://www.healthnet.org

After recieving the above message, the GetWeb server would format the
HealthNet home page as human-readable plain-text and send it to you.

You can enclose your commands in a begin/end block, or comment out
lines with '#':


This preamble will not be processed by the MailBot...
begin
GET http://www.healthnet.org
# ...neither will this comment
end
...and neither will this signature.


A hotlist[1] of URLs which we consider especially interesting is
available.

Each hypertext link is represented by a number in brackets. Suppose
you get a message like this from a GetWeb server:

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Some important conferences carried by SatelLife include:

     * ProMED: Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases[1]
     * ProCAARE: Program for Collaboration Against AIDS[2]
     * E-Drug: Essential Drugs[3]

[2] http://www.healthnet.org/programs/procaare.html
[3] http://www.healthnet.org/programs/edrug.html

--------------------------------------------------------------------

To get more information about ProCAARE, you would look up link 2 at
the bottom of the message to find out the URL is
http://www.healthnet.org/programs/procaare.html. You would then send
a message to the GetWeb server:

GET http://www.healthnet.org/programs/procaare.html
