Incoming document was corrupted or truncated. Tips:

* Forward the entire document to GetWeb, including any sections marked '** Form section (ignore) **' or '** References in this Document **'

* Try forwarding the document rather than 'replying with included text'

* If you input a new left-bracket or right-bracket, escape it with a '\'

Still having trouble?  Email the getweb administrator.
